This folder contains all the CNN models trained on the EfficientNet architecture for classifying fatigue in different parts of the face. You can find the litreature for this architecture by clicking <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946">here</a>. There are 5 models each indivudally trained on Deprived and Non-Deprived images of people. They are :
<ul>
<li>Eyes</li>
<li>Face</li>
<li>Mouth</li>
<li>Nose</li>
<li>Undereyes</li>
</ul>
